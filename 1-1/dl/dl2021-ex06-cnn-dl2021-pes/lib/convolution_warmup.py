    """Calculate the dot product of a small chunk of X with a single filter.

    Args:
        X: Array of shape (n_channels, image_height, image_width).
        F: The filter to apply. Array of shape (n_channels, filter_height, filter_width).
        index: Index of X where the top left corner of the filter should be placed.

    Returns:
        Scalar value which is the sum of product of the filter and section of X.

        For example, consider that your input X is a 5x5 image with only one channel as follows:

        X =
        [[[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
          [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
          [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
          [15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
          [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]]]

        X.shape = (1, 5, 5)

        and we're using a 3x3 kernel as follows:

        F =
        [[[0, 1, 2],
          [3, 4, 5],
          [6, 7, 8]]]

        F.shape = (1, 3, 3)

        If the given index is (2, 1), then you should compute the sum of the elements of :

        [[[11, 12, 13],              [[[0, 1, 2],
          [16, 17, 18],       *        [3, 4, 5],
          [21, 22, 23]]]               [6, 7, 8]]]

        where * is an elementwise multiplication operation.

        Assume that the kernel will not go outside the boundaries of X. For example, in this case,
        the index (2, 3) is invalid.

        The scalar value that is returned corresponds to a single element in a single activation
        map (see slide 26).
